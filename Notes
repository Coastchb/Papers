二.<Phoneme recognition using time-delay neural networks>
(1)The particular choice of 3 frames (30 ms) was motivated by earlier studies [26]-[29] that suggest that a 30 ms window might be sufficient to represent low level acoustic-phonetic events for stop consonant recognition.   
(2)The choice of a larger 5 frame window in this layer was motivated by the intuition that higher level units should learn to make decisions over a wider range in time based on more local abstractions at lower levels.
